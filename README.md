Food crisis is an issue faced on an international scale due to various reasons such as poverty, unsuitable land for cultivation. In India despite being an agricultural country, we face this problem on a large scale mainly the reason being poverty. Food and quality food is an essential part of economy on lower level. This issue can be resolved and has been attempted to be by various sectors using several modes. What compelled us to think further was that if we introduce a reward-based food vending machine which works both the sides for the donor as well as the receiver. And in order to implement this we came with an idea of minimal education for underprivileged population. We incorporate a method wherein on answering suitable number of questions the food (kept in refrigerator) by the people (of locality) will be dispatched.
